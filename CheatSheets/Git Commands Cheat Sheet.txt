Git Commands

git init -> Initializes git repository
git clone <github-repo-url> -> Clones code workspace from remote repo
git add <file-name> -> Stages changes in selected file to next commit
git commit -m "Message" -> Saves changes within local git repository
git push -> Pushes changes to remote repository
git pull -> Pulls changes from remote repository

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Tricks:
	git add . -> The dot adds all changed files in current 
workspace to next commit
	git log -> Lets you look at your history of commits within a
repository
	git log --oneline -> Lets you look at the shortened version of
your commit history within a repository
	git status -> Lets you know what files have been changed and 
wether or not they've been staged for your next commit
	git remote add <remote-repo-name> <repo-url> -> Lets you add 
another remote repository to your current workspace when working 
between multiple remote repos

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Git Rules:
	Every commit must have a message attached to it. Doesnt matter
what the message is so long as its there. Use this to your advantage
to give description to every change you make over time.
	To push a change to remote repository you must first commit, if 
you dont commit before pushing, your staged changes will not be added to
the remote repo.
